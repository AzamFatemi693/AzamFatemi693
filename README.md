# About me 

I am a dedicated and passionate data analyst with a talent for uncovering hidden patterns and valuable insights. With my technical expertise, analytical mindset, and strong communication skills, I am positioned to make a significant impact in the field of data analysis. Naturally curious and observant, I thrive on new challenges and never stop seeking out learning opportunities and sharing knowledge.


# Previous Experience 

In February 2018, I began my role at BAN Company, a commerce company specializing in materials related to building like tiles and faucets. Unfortunately, I don't have current data to present, but my previous responsibilities included collecting raw data from the factory in Excel format and processing, analyzing, and presenting reports to my manager and other teams. This involved cleaning the data using Excel and SQL, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data type conversion. I was also responsible for managing outliers.

My company held the exclusive representation of tiles under the brand named AGHIGH. One of our significant challenges arose from the factory producing tiles with the same quality under different brands and models, presenting a competitive obstacle for us.

After thorough analysis and reporting, I proposed a strategic solution: the creation of a package for external sellers and our company representatives. The package featured AGHIGH tiles with a minimum profit margin, accompanied by other products such as faucets characterized by unique quality and higher profit margins.

This initiative aimed to address the challenge posed by competitors and provide a competitive edge for our offerings. Regular analysis was essential to continually refine and optimize the package for maximum effectiveness in the market.

Another challenge arose during winter when sales declined due to delays caused by extreme weather conditions in construction projects. Using historical sales data, I identified sellers with strong performances and suggested adjusting prices to encourage bulk purchases, particularly for products that have been in the warehouse for over two months.

I also undertook segmentation responsibilities, considering various customer parameters and labeling them accordingly. Key performance indicators such as sales revenue, conversion rate, customer acquisition costs, and the impact of inflation on sales were regularly measured and reported using statistical techniques and data visualizations.

### Adopting these strategies leads to a yearly growth of 10% in the company's profitability. 



# Move to The Netherlands 

In May 2022, I relocated to the Netherlands with my husband. Therfore, I decieded to enhance my technical skills to gain a deeper understanding of data analysis and acquiring valuable certifications. 
In January 2023, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in the MasterSchool Bootcamp, where I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum focused on data analysis. Over the course, I successfully completed three projects showcasing my proficiency in utilizing a diverse range of tools and technologies. Leveraging Python with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Requests, and Beautiful Soup, I adeptly navigated complex datasets. Additionally, I demonstrated my skills in SQL queries, Excel, and pivot tables for data manipulation and analysis. For impactful visualizations, I harnessed the power of Tableau and Power BI tools, completing three projects


# Power BI

In addition to providing a link to my GitHub repository showcasing various projects, I am also including a Power BI link to showcase multiple dashboards within the Power BI environment. This additional link pertains to a Data Analytics Project specifically conducted for Wisabi Bank, a prominent financial institution based in Nigeria. Please note that this project is hypothetical and does not involve real data or actions. Wisabi Bank's headquarters is situated in Lagos, with branches in Kano, Rivers State, Enugu, and FCT Abuja.
